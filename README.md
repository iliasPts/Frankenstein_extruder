# Frankenstein_extruder
Frankenstein is an extruder built for modularity and versatility. Designed with affordability in mind, itâ€™s initially tailored for articulated robots but adaptable to various numerically controled machines, including 3D printers.

Its distinctive feature is the complete accessibility of its components, fully exposed to the view like a body laid open for dissection. This openness allows users to configure countless setups by rearranging electronic, pneumatic, and hose connections.  This modularity is also made possible by the implementation of new programs (in arduino format) enabling new functions. In this way, the system can be expanded by adding new components (e.g. extrusion control sensors) that take advantage of the many electronic lines left available for this very purpose.

Beyond flexibility, Frankenstein is designed for interactive operation (with operators or data exterior to the system), incorporating multiple input and output interfaces (buttons, knobs, LCD displays, sensors, etc.), all programmable to meet specific user needs. This makes it particularly valuable in educational and research contexts.

Frankenstein is therefore not an extruder driven by precision or reliability, but by exploration, creativity and serendipity. In the words of philosopher Gilbert Simondon, it's a machine, unfinished, open and imperfect.
