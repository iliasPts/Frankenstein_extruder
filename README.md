# Frankenstein_extruder
Frankenstein is an extruder designed for modularity and versatility. Engineered for affordability it is initially made to fit into articulated robots, but can be adapted to other numerically controled machines like 3D printers.

Its distinctive feature is the complete accessibility of its components, fully exposed to the view like a body laid open for dissection. With this same kit, you can imagine a multitude of possible configurations by unplugging and replugging in a new way the various electronic, pneumatic and hose connections. This modularity is also made possible by the implementation of new programs (in arduino format) enabling new functions. In this way, the system can be expanded by adding new components (e.g. extrusion control sensors) that take advantage of the many electronic lines left available for this very purpose.

As well as being flexible, Frankenstein is designed to allow interaction with operators or data from outside the system, by including a variety of input and output interfaces (buttons, knobs, lcd displays, sensors etc.), all of which can be programmed to suit the user's needs. This makes this extruder particularly suitable for educational or research purposes.

Frankenstein is therefore not an extruder driven by precision or reliability, but by exploration, creativity and serendipity. In the words of philosopher Gilbert Simondon, it's a machine, unfinished, open and imperfect.
